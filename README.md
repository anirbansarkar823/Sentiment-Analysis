# Sentiment_Analysis
:

After going through various blogs and research papers, I performed sentiment analysis on tweets. 
As of now, only positive and negative classfication was done.

In today’s world, text is considered to be the most common means of information exchange. But
day by day, the heap of text is increasing on internet making it difficult for us to churn out
valuable information of it. This is where text mining plays its role by enabling better
understanding of information out of these set of texts so that we can come up with smart
decisions. Various machine learning techniques can be used for the text classification to get
valuable information from the text data. To get better results in terms of enhanced accuracy, data
cleaning and feature selection methods can be applied before any text mining technique, which
in our case is sentiment analysis. Data cleaning and feature selection can improve the learning
process with less computational complexity and storage requirements. In this research we have
used a number of data cleaning and feature selection techniques along with the selected
classification algorithms like NB, MNB, BNB, LR and SVM. Experimental results show that
these techniques are efficient and enhance the classification performance. Here we have used
NLTK corpus for movie reviews and an online dataset of tweets for training and testing purpose.
